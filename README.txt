To run each of the programs separately you must first open your terminal or console in the folder named AssignmentPCP1 and
the first thing you would want to do is type make clean so my program can run on your java version compiler. When you are done you can type
java -cp bin <name of the program you wish to run> <image input with extension> <image output with extension> <window size width> then press enter

First: make clean

Complete example: java -cp bin MeanFilterSerial.java img1.jpg img1.jpg 3

Alternatively, you can use the MAKEFILE to run any program
E.g. If you want to run MeanFilterSerial.java you can type instead: 
make run-MeanFilterSerial ARGS="<image input with extension> <image output with extension> <window size width>"

Complete example: make run-MeanFilterSerial ARGS="img1.jpg img1.jpg 3"

If you want to run the whole experiment using all sliding- window widths I used and all the images you can run
the Experiment.py file by typing on the console: python3 Experiment.py 

If you want to generate javadocs from the source files you can type on the console: javadoc -d doc src/*.java
Or alternatively use the makefile by typing: make javaDoc


Hint: use Ubuntu or vs code editor to run the assignment. However, whichever way you prefer would suffice.

To check the output of the filter, look at the image called output.jpg inside the image folder!
